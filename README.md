### I am...
#### Detail-oriented: Got a bug that needs fixing? Something not quite right with the logic or your syntax of a funtion? I have a knack for seeing tiny details that are easily overlooked.
#### A collaborator: Sure it's fun to build solo projects and have ownership of what you are creating, but working with a team to make products better than I could ever do alone is how I like to work!
#### A self learner: What better way to spend Saturday morning than learning a new skill?!
#### A believer in the value of Diversity: I am comfortable and confident working in diverse environments. I believe that diverse teams lead to new, innovative, and inclusive ideas.
